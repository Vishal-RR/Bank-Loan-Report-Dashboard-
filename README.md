Here's a simplified summary of the KPIs, Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs, Loan Status Grid View, and Charts:

# Summary of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

## KPIs:

1. **Total Loan Applications:** Track the total number of loan applications, Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
  
2. **Total Funded Amount:** Understand total funds disbursed as loans, MTD funded amount, and MoM changes.
  
3. **Total Amount Received:** Monitor the total amount received from borrowers, MTD amount received, and MoM changes.
  
4. **Average Interest Rate:** Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, MTD rate, and MoM variations.
  
5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluate average DTI for borrowers, MTD DTI, and MoM fluctuations.

## Good Loan vs Bad Loan KPIs:

**Good Loan:**
- Good Loan Application Percentage
- Good Loan Applications

## Loan Status Grid View:

- Categorized grid view report by 'Loan Statusâ€™.
- Metrics: Total Loan Applications, Total Funded Amount, Total Amount Received, MTD Funded Amount, MTD Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, and Average DTI.

## Charts:

1. **Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart):** Identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
  
2. **Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map):** Identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.
  
3. **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):** Understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

- **Total Funded Amount:** Summing up the total amount of funds disbursed as loans.
  
- **MTD Total Funded Amount:** Determining Month-to-Date total funded amounts for a specific month.
  
- **Total Amount Received:** Calculating the total amount received from borrowers.
  
- **MTD Total Amount Received:** Computing Month-to-Date total received amounts for a specific month.
  
- **Average Interest Rate:** Finding the average interest rate across all loans.
  
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Calculating the average DTI for borrowers.

These queries also distinguish between good and bad loans, categorize loans by status, and provide insights through various visualizations, including monthly trends, regional analysis, and borrower demographics.
